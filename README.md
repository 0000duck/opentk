OpenTK
======

The Open Toolkit is an advanced, low-level C# library that wraps OpenGL, OpenCL and OpenAL. The OpenTK home is http://www.opentk.com/

This is an unofficial fork for community changes that we hope will someday make it into the official repository. Unfortunately, the only official maintainer of OpenTK has been missing since early 2012.

This fork was created from the latest official SVN repository. It contains numerous fixes by the original maintainer that are not found in the last release (2010-10-06). This fork is based on AndyKorth's OpenTK fork with lots of fixes from all over the community. 

Documentation
=============

The best source of documentation is the [OpenTK Manual](http://www.opentk.com/doc)
