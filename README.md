OpenTK
======

The Open Toolkit is an advanced, low-level C# library that wraps OpenGL, OpenCL and OpenAL. This is an unofficial fork for changes that may someday make it into the official repository. The OpenTK home is http://www.opentk.com/, but has not received much love in the recent years (no updates since early 2012).
Based on AndyKorth's OpenTK fork with lots of fixes from all over the community, once we find some time in the future we will merge our OpenTK changes and fixes into this as well.

OpenTK Version: 1.1.1160.61462 (build 2013-03-07), also available via nuget (OpenTK and OpenTKWithOpenAL) and used in the DeltaEngine.
